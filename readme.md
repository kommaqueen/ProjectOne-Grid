#  01 Pretty Grid Layout Challenge
This is the first of weekly challenges I set up for myself to practice web design and implement best practices and various techniques.

## Template
The template idea was sourced from this image found on Pinterest: [text] (https://i.pinimg.com/originals/de/fb/80/defb809ac4e5d09d2708c76f3e5c16df.jpg)

## Objectives
* Use component CSS library
* Use flexbox & grid techniques
* Make mobile responsive
* Use :root variables to control color and font
* Alternate image/text pattern in grid on smaller screens

## Comments & Possible Improvements
* Ran into challenges with the images as children of the grid cards,so I instead added their styling directly to the card
* Would like to add hover effects over the images that blur them, or add a gradient with a text overlay
* The small-screen nav-list a tags could be improved to a dropdown or wrap better somehow, as they are a bit cramped in the grid I set them in to maintain the one-line look
